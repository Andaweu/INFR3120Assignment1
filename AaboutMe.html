                <article>
                <p>Hey there! My name is Andrew Chester and I am currently a student here at Ontario Tech University. I am studying Technical Management in the faculty of Business and IT. I grew up in Markham, Ontario and attended St. Roberts Catholic Highschool.
                    <br>
                    I primarily do my developing in the Python coding language however, I also have experience with C++, Java, Docker and Bash Scripting.
                    <br>
                    While I do jump around with my hobbies I am very into building computers and homelabbing. I currently run 2 main servers for myself and my family. I have also built my own PC (specs listed below) that I use daily for classes, work and hobbies.
                    <br>
                    I am also quite into gaming. I am currently finishing Final Fantasy VII remake on PS5. Helldivers 2 is also a personal favorite of mine right now, playing it on PC.
                    <br>
                    Clash of Clans is my most played game right now and I am currently standing in the top 2000 in Canada.
                    <br>
                    During my freetime should the weather permit I enjoy going out and taking photographs. Below I have left some of my photos I have taken over the past few years.
                    <br>
                    Thank you for visiting my website and remember to reach out to me throught the <a href="AcontactMe.html">contact me</a> page or reach out on @andawu on Discord.
