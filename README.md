Dimensions of viewport

For mobile devices, a width of 480px is used to ensure compatability with smaller and older devices. Many lower end devices still have lower resolutions so having a resolution of 480px.

For tablet devices, a width between 480px and 960px is used as the cap for many mobile phones is 480px and many tablet devices use a resolution of 960px. As tablets still arent typically as large as laptop or desktop screens it is an ideal middle ground to ensure readability while also taking advantage of the additional space.

For laptop and desktop devices, a width of 960px as a minimum is used to allow for greater use of the display space. With a larger resolution content can be enlargened and more content can also be placed on a single line.

-#FAF500
-#6B2FBA
-#6C00FA
-#A5A337

This is an adobe color scheme using the complementary harmony. This was used to allow for a great contrast between two colors, allowing for a greater than 4.5:1 to allow for greater visibility and thus, accessability validation.
